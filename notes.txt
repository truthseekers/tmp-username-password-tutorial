Where does the req.login come from in the signup route? Passport exposes it on req. So.. this probably comes from doing the app.use(passport).
I'm guessing it attaches a .login() on the req.
See: https://www.passportjs.org/concepts/authentication/login/

***Issue: For some reason I have to login with a working account, then log out. THEN I can create an account which will log in after creation.
If I just turn on the server and create an account I get an error "failed to deserialize".
